Licenses
There is software behind TLE and other CommunityUs projects soon to arrive that is protected by GPL.

It is important to respect the wishes of the developers and people behind the respective projects.

See below for a summary of the licenses behind TLE, CommunityUs and its cores:

[Last Update: 11/18/20]

GPL - Starting from commit 30 we will begin closely tracking the changes. /bin/ /docs/ /lib/Lacuna/ /t/ /var/ are impacted. The rest of the folders contain no content aside from the /var/www/public/ folder which contains non-copyleft content that is later added to using MIT from the Ken√≥ Antigen project. A GPL license is added to the project by @haarg 9 years ago.

MIT - These are the folders: (a license file is found in the early commits)
