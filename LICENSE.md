### Licenses
There is software behind TLE and other CommunityUs projects soon to arrive that is protected by GPL. Other parts are non-copyleft and less restrictive.

It is important to respect the wishes of the developers and people behind the respective projects.

See below for a summary of the licenses behind TLE, CommunityUs and its cores:

(A GPL license is added to the project by [Graham] @haarg 9 years ago we have moved the license into each subfolder where GPL is used. Folders where GPL is not used are also clearly documented with their own license.)

[Last Update: 11/18/20]

1. GPL (mainly the Perl 5 server) - /bin/ /docs/ /lib/Lacuna/ /t/ /var/ are impacted. The rest of the folders contain no content aside from the /var/www/public/ folder which contains non-copyleft content that is later added to using MIT from the Ken√≥ Antigen project.

1. Permissive non-copyleft that moves to MIT (mainly the web client) - These are the folders: (a license file is found in the early commits)
- server (server here refers to the MIT nodejs server and not The Lacuna Expanse server which is GPLv2 found above)
- /.vscode/ /app/ /config/ /css/ /gulp-tasks/ /js/ /misc/ /scripts/
- To Do: [metion /var/ folder license]
