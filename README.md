Dual license repo of The Lacuna Expance GPLv2 and MIT serated for clarity using submodules.

The GPL has been for the server code and MIT for the web based client.

The GPL license is found in /info/ folder. It was moved from the root folder to /info/ folder on this commit:
 - https://github.com/plainblack/Lacuna-Server-Open/blob/17d22cbb60288d2c27c41427c6d5ef1d7ba1bb55/info/LICENSE
 - https://github.com/communityus/info/blob/main/license.txt
 
Our repo may go forwards and backwards in time for archival purposes and for feature comparisons. To be clear the GPL license can always be easily traced in the main repro from Plainblack Corp.
